# Continental primary productivity and geographic beta diversity 

\

## Abstract  

\

**Aim** Ecosystem functions, such as productivity, may be influenced not only by the biological diversity at each location (α-diversity), but also by the biological turnover between locations (β-diversity). We perform a continental-scale test of the strength and direction of relationships between gross primary productivity (GPP) and both α- and β-diversity. 

\

**Location** Continental Australia. 

\

**Methods** Species occurrence records were used to quantify the taxonomic α-diversity of vascular plants at ~11,000 1 km × 1 km grid cells across Australia, and to calculate the mean β-diversity within a 10 km radius around each cell. The magnitude and variability of monthly, MODIS-derived remotely sensed GPP (2001-2012) were summarised for continental Australia, as were rainfall and temperature over the same period. Generalised additive models were then used to test whether GPP magnitude or variability were distinctly influenced by either biodiversity measure, over and above the influence of environmental conditions. 

\

**Results** Precipitation and temperature explained large proportions of deviance in the magnitude (75.6 %) and variability (38.3 %) of GPP across the Australian continent. GPP was marginally more strongly related to species richness than it was to species turnover. However, neither diversity measure provided substantial increases in the explanatory power of GPP models, over and above that of environment-only models (always <1 %).  

\

**Main conclusions** The relationship between primary productivity and taxonomic α- and β-diversity was weak for the Australian flora. Our findings question the generality of key assumptions, predictions and results in the literature regarding the strength of empirical relationships between productivity and biodiversity across multiple biological levels (α-, β- and γ-diversity) at macroecological scales.

\

## Methods 

\

To determine the strength of relationships between GPP and α- and β-diversity at relatively fine spatial resolution across continental Australia, we combined observational species records with continuous spatial layers for GPP and environmental conditions. Firstly, we derived the mean (magnitude, GPP mean) and coefficient of variation (variability, GPP CV) of GPP, rainfall and temperature using existing monthly surfaces from January 2001 to December 2012 at 1 km × 1 km spatial resolution. We then extracted GPP and environmental values for approximately 27,000 1 km × 1 km grid cells where the species records provided reasonable α-diversity estimates. We then further restricted the data to approximately 11,000 cells with the highest-quality species records, and calculated empirical β-diversity values. From these refined cells, we subsampled approximately 1000 cells within 20 km 3 20 km blocks, repeating the subsampling 1000 times as described below. Generalized additive models were then fitted to all 1000 subsamples to test relationships between GPP and biodiversity.

## Continental datasets

\

It was recently proposed that ecologists should shift their focus from the α-dimension of biodiversity (biological richness) to the β-dimension (biological turnover), in order to find broad-scale, cause and effect links between ecosystem functions and biodiversity in natural environments (Pasari et al., 2013). This idea has intuitive appeal. It seems plausible that the spatial and temporal turnover of plants between locations within a region, and hence the turnover in their characteristics, would affect the magnitude and variability of ecosystem functions such as primary productivity, both at individual locations and across entire regions. This is because floristic turnover — in geographic and environmental space, and also through time — indirectly approximates spatio-temporal changes in the biophysical characteristics of the flora, which could influence spatio-temporal fluctuations in the photosynthetic flux of carbon (Figure 1.1).

### Gross primary productivity and Environmental conditions

The response variable, GPP, was defined as the gross photosynthetic uptake of atmospheric carbon. We employed monthly, 250 m × 250 m spatial resolution estimates of GPP from January 2001 to December 2012 [GPP, gC m-2 month-1, Donohue et al. (2014)]. Spatio-temporal fluctuations in GPP are primarily driven by climatic conditions at continental scales, and particularly by rainfall in the Australian context. Key environmental conditions were defined as the total monthly rainfall (mm month-1) and the mean monthly maximum temperature (°C) from January 2001 to December 2012.

Plots of each variable across the time series (January 2001-December 2012) are shown in the right panels for two points in eastern Australia (black and grey triangles in the bottom right panel, 152°11'4.356" E  29°15'26.352" S, and 149°14'33.193" E  30°21'23.725" S, respectively). Inset panels on the right show a detail of the CV surface for each variable across the time series (GPP CV in brown, rainfall CV in blue and temperature CV in orange, which are indicated on the main maps by red and black inset panels).

## Alpha and beta diversity of vascular plants across Australia

\

The original biological data consisted of approximately 2.2 million species occurrence records from the Australian National Heritage Assessment Tool database [ANHAT, Slatyer et al. (2007)], comprising ~12,500 vascular plant species and 83 families (Williams et al., 2012). To quantify the β-diversity in a 10 km radius surrounding each retained grid cell, we first calculated the Simpson’s dissimilarity (βsim) for each pair of grid cells in that area (equation 1):

**Figure 3.2**. Flow diagram depicting the quantification of α- and β-diversity values. The original species occurrences (a) were aggregated into approximately 400,000 1 km × 1 km grid cells (b). We then calculated the maximum α-diversity in any cell within a 20 km radius (c). This 20km surface was then averaged within a 50 km radius of each cell, creating Smax: the mean of the average maximum α-diversity within a 20 km radius (d). Cells were excluded if α-diversity was either <10 or <25% of the Smax, and also if fewer than 10 locations were retained within a 10 km radius. For the remaining grid cells (e), β-diversity was quantified using a linear weighting scheme to calculate the pairwise Simpson dissimilarity within a 10 km radius (i.e. dmax = 10km). The focal cell (in red) received a weight of 1, and the peripheral cells a weight of 0. The average β-diversity for the focal cell (f) was then calculated as the mean weighted average of all pairwise comparisons [i.e. Wij  = (Wi + Wj )/2)].

Mean Simpson dissimilarity within a 10 km radius of all sites (‘β’ in panels, dark red indicates higher β). A zoom of the Darwin region is shown for both diversity measures (the colour scales for α and β match between the maps and the scatterplots). c). Scatterplots of the response (GPP mean and CV) and predictor variables for all candidate sites (top half of scatterplot, note the greater range of axes values) and a subsample of 1107 sites (bottom half). GPP is the mean monthly photosynthetic flux of carbon (gC m-2 month-1, January 2001-December 2012/12), GPP CV is the standard deviation of GPP divided by the mean. ‘Rain’ is the average total monthly precipitation (mm month-1), temp is the mean monthly maximum temperature (°C).

## Statistical Analyses

\

The true functional nature of macroecological relationships will vary considerably across Australia, due to strong spatio-temporal dependencies. 
Thus we adopted a flexible approach using generalised additive models (GAMs). Three model comparisons were run: 

\

(1) Environment (rainfall + temperature) + α vs. environment 
(2) Environment + β vs. environment
(3) Environment + α + β (i.e. full model) vs. environment + α 

\


## Results

\

The weakest individual predictor of continental GPP mean or GPP CV was β-diversity (Table 3.1, Table 3.2). This was confirmed by the comparative models, where adding β-diversity to the full models provided no substantial increase in the additional percentage of deviance explained for either GPP response.

**Figure 3.4.** Plots of one of the continental generalised additive models, showing raw observations for one random subsample (blue points). Predicted gross primary productivity values (GPP and GPP CV) for models using only that predictor [e.g. GPP = f (rain) for top row of panel] are plotted in green. Predicted GPP values for models holding all other variables at their mean [e.g. GPP = f (rain + mean temp + mean α + mean β) for top row of panel] are also plotted in orange. GPP is the mean monthly photosynthetic flux of carbon (gC m-2 month-1, January 2001-December 2012, see section 3.2.1). GPP CV is the ratio of the standard deviation in GPP to the mean.

## Conclusions

\

The analysis of broad-scale relationships between productivity and biodiversity is not new. However, empirical, continental-scale tests of relationships between ecosystem functions as response variables, and biological richness and heterogeneity as explanatory variables, are in their infancy. We found that adding taxonomic α- and β-diversity to simple models of the magnitude and variability of continental primary productivity contributed no meaningful explanatory power, with a striking lack of support for longstanding assumptions in the literature. It is reasonable to ask whether these results question the logic of using simple measures of biological diversity – however they are quantified – as explanatory variables for broad-scale productivity measures. Indeed our results may indicate that both measures of productivity and simple diversity indices are more appropriately placed on the y-axis, responding to the same environmental conditions (Lavers & Field, 2006), at least across such broad spatio-temporal and biological scales. Nevertheless, more targeted measures of ecological specialisation – such as site-level environmental niche widths – may potentially have distinct relationships with certain ecosystem functions, particularly under environmental change scenarios.

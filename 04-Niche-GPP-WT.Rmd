# Bioregional primary productivity and community-level niche width 

\

## Abstract  

\

**Aim** A key debate in contemporary ecology is whether ecosystem functions are distinctly influenced by biological diversity, across broad scales. Although recent work has emphasised the importance of links between ecosystem functions and measures of ecological specialisation as proxies of biodiversity, few studies have empirically analysed net, macroecological relationships in diverse environments. We tested whether gross primary productivity (GPP) in the Australian Wet Tropics (WT) was distinctly related to community-level measures of the ecological specialisation of component tree species across environmental space, after accounting for environmental drivers. 

\

**Location** WT biogeographic region, Australia.  

\

**Methods** Using all geographically valid herbarium records for 948 WT tree species, we quantified realised environmental niche widths using continental surfaces for maximum temperature of the warmest period and total annual rainfall. The median realised niche width for all tree species occurring at 510 sites was used to approximate ecological specialisation within communities. To partial out the direct effects of abiotic environment on GPP, we applied a novel analysis based on the difference in GPP and the difference in median community realised niche width between site-pairs with similar environmental conditions. Linear models were then run on the difference in GPP between site-pairs (response) and the difference in environmental niche widths (predictor). 

\

**Results** For environmentally similar sites in drier areas, GPP was higher in sites comprising species with narrower temperature niches (average R2 = 0.087, average t-statistic = -3.45). Conversely, for environmentally similar sites in drier areas, GPP was lower in sites comprising species with narrower rainfall niches (average R2 = 0.171, average T-statistic = 5.06).  

\

**Main conclusions** Wet Tropics sites with more thermal specialists had higher productivity, whereas sites with more moisture specialists had lower productivity. These mixed findings suggest that physiological specialisation across environmental space can influence primary productivity at broad scales, but in inconsistent ways.

\

## Methods 

\

The notion that the ecosystem functions at a location — for example primary productivity — could be influenced not only by the environment, but also by the diversity of the biota itself, goes back to at least the writings of Darwin, and probably much earlier. Here we conduct a novel empirical test of the macroecological complementarity hypothesis. For pairs of Wet Tropics sites, we assess whether sites comprising species with collectively narrower niches – those that have a greater degree of ecological specialisation – are more productive, after removing the influence of site environment. We use gross primary productivity (GPP) as a measure of ecosystem functioning. GPP is defined as the photosynthetic flux of carbon between vegetation and the atmosphere (Monteith, 1972; Donohue et al., 2014). We predict that pairwise GPP will be negatively linearly related to pairwise niche width (Figure 5.1).

### Wet Tropics datasets

Our study region encompasses the Wet Tropics bioregion of Australia (Thackway & Cresswell, 1995) and the surrounding area within a 100 km buffer [approximately 
113,003 km2, with the extent top: 14° 35' 51.746" S, left: 143° 48' 12.463" E, bottom: 20° 27' 55.175" S, right: 147° 35' 0.561" E, see Figure 5.2]. Species’ 
realised continental environmental niche widths were estimated using average annual values from 1976-2005 of total annual rainfall (mm) and maximum temperature 
of the warmest period (°C) at 250 m × 250 m spatial resolution (Figure 5.2).

**Figure 5.2.** We tested the macroecological complementarity hypothesis by combing continental environmental surfaces with ecological plot surveys and observational plant records. Maps of average gross primary productivity (GPP) for the Wet Tropics (gC m-2 month-1 2001-2012 in brown, a, used to quantify site productivity), and for eastern Australia. Maps of total monthly rainfall for the Wet Tropics (mm month-1 2001-2012 in blue, b, used to quantify site rainfall), and of annual rainfall across continental Australia (mm 1976-2005, used to quantify median site rainfall niche width). Maps of mean monthly daily maximum temperature for the Wet Tropics (°C 2001-2012 in orange, c, used to quantify site temperature), and of the maximum temperature of the warmest period across continental Australia (°C 1976-2005, used to quantify median site temperature niche width). Histograms of environmental values for the Wet Tropics are shown below each surface. The top row of histograms are for the whole Wet Tropics study region, and the bottom row are for only the 510 WT sites (d). The niche width of each tree species occurring at the sites was defined as the middle 90% of environmental values for all Australian records of that species [e.g. Ficus congesta, e, with the rain niche width in blue (RW) and temperature niche width in orange (TW)].

\

### Statistical analyses

\

We tested the macroecological complementarity hypothesis by quantifying the relationship between the difference in GPP for pairs of Wet Tropics sites, and the difference in community-level summaries of species rainfall and temperature niche width (Figure 5.1 , for site-level relationships, see Appendix 4, Table S4.1, Table S4.2 and Table S4.3).
To determine the variable rainfall limit, we modelled site GPP as a negative exponential function of site rainfall — a positively monotonically increasing non-linear regression.To minimise the influence of any particular site on the results, we randomised the subset of environmentally similar site-pairs 500 times, and then subsampled from these pairs so that each site appeared only once in the final subsample set of site-pairs :


lm (GPP difference between sites ~ temperature niche width difference between sites)
lm (GPP difference between sites ~ rainfall niche width difference between sites)


For each linear model, we tested the relationship between pairwise GPP difference and pairwise niche difference (Figure 5.1) using three diagnostic measures, which were averaged across all 500 subsamples [using the R stats package, version 1.8.4, R Core Team (2015)].

Scatterplots of site GPP vs. all variables in the analysis (a), RNW: median rainfall niche width of all tree species occurring at the site (mm 1976-2005), TNW: median temperature niche width of all tree species at the site (°C 1976-2005). The 510 Wet Tropics sites (b) used to generate pairwise variables were considered in three sets; all sites, drier sites receiving ≤138 mm monthly rainfall (mostly in savannah environments) and wetter sites receiving ≥139 mm monthly rainfall (mostly in rainforest environments). The upper and lower limits of allowable differences in rainfall between site-pairs vary across the gradient based on a negative exponential model of site GPP (gC m-2 month-1) as a function of site rainfall (c, blue and red lines respectively, see methods).  It is also important to note that using the response variable (GPP) to constrain the explanatory variable (niche width) raises the problem of circularity. Particularly, the variable rainfall limit constrains the difference in GPP between pairs of sites to a relatively low level. This could reduce the effect of niche-width on GPP (similar to the bias towards wetter and more productive sites observed in chapter 3). However, using a different relationship for calculating the variable rainfall limit (for example a global GPP–rainfall relationship) is equally problematic, given that this would forgo the advantages of calibrating the analysis to the biogeography of Wet Tropics. A simple alternative is to either use a fixed limit (as was used for temperature), or to use a standard multiple regression at the site level (so just using 510 sites, with site GPP ~ site environment + site niche width, see Appendix 4, Tables S4.1, S4.2 and S4.3). 

\


## Results

\

For site-pairs calculated from all original 510 sites — spanning the entire rainfall gradient from 42-516 mm of monthly rainfall — GPP was moderately related to both temperature and rainfall niche width. The strength of these relationships was similar for both rainfall and temperature niches across the entire rainfall gradient (Table 5.1, average adjusted R2 across 500 subsamples = 0.087 for temperature niche width and 0.083 for rainfall niche width).

## Conclusions

\

We demonstrated that primary productivity was related to community-level measures of ecological specialisation at macroecological scales in natural environments. Wet Tropics sites with more ecological specialists in temperature space had higher productivity, whereas sites with more ecological specialists in rainfall space had lower productivity. Future analyses could focus on the degree to which species’ physiological performance is related to their realised niche width under current and future climates, to directly test the physiological basis for the hypothesis that ecological specialisation increases productivity.
